to_crb-blast
============
CRB-BLAST is a novel method for finding orthologs between one set of sequences and another ([Aubry et al. 2014](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004365)). The tool is avaliable [here](https://github.com/cboursnell/crb-blast). "to_crb-blast" is a parser that enables conversion of the BLAST output files from default pairwise format (standard text format) into extended tabular format to fit crb-blast. The "main.sh" script in this github repo dominstrates lunching of an Amazon instance to do the job.
